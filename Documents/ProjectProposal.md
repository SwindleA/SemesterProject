A little language that reads right to left utilizing hebrew alphabet instead of roman alphabet. Basically python that is right to left. I will follow a similar format as the r2p.py example. If time allows, I will also make a compiler. 


Hello World example:

python: print("Hello World")

new language:

("שלום עולם" )הדפס
